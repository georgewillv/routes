# Interview Project for [Company name Omitted for Privacy]

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was pushed to the Cloud using Heroku, you can find more about it [here](heroku.com).

## Issues I've encountered:

### 2/12/2020 
1. Translating HTML forms to react forms were more challening than expected; likely because this is my first time learning react. 

2. I've got the barebones form up and running on local machine. Currently trying to figure out how to get the sent form data as a value.
