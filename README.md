# Interview Project for C.H Robinson

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was pushed to the Cloud using Heroku, you can find more about it [here](heroku.com).

## Issues I've encountered:

### 2/12/2020 
1. Translating HTML forms to react forms were more challening than expected; likely because this is my first time learning react. 

2. I've got the barebones form up and running on local machine. Currently trying to figure out how to get the sent form data as a value.


### 2/14/2020
1. To get form data you need to reference 'this.state.variable_name' figured out my problem from friday after some googling and failing with possible variable names like locEnd, and event.target.value .
2. Struggling to get logic to traverse countries working in 'getRoutes'. Edge cases work but something is likely wrong with for loop.
